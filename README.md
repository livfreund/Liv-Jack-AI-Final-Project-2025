# AI-Final-Project-2025

In my first semester at Boston University, I took the class CS 664 called Artificial Intelligence. For our final project, our professor gave us the freedom to use any 
aspect of artificial intelligence we've learned in class to accomplish a task. My partner, Jack Vanourny, and I chose to use an algorithm called "Dancing Links" to solve any given sodoku problem. 

I chose to take this class during my first semester at Boston University because of the rapidly accelerating role of artificial intelligence across nearly every area of technology. I wanted to develop both an understanding of current AI capabilities and the technical foundation needed to adapt to future advancements in this field.
